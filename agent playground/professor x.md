# Professor X

**Professor X** is a Copilot agent that reviews uploaded conversation transcripts and scores how you run customer and project discussions. It looks at things like technical depth, selling skills, and how well you can tell the story. It checks how you open topics, respond to questions, and handle objections during live calls.

The agent looks at clarity, confidence, how you explain value, and how well you connect customer needs to the project. The goal is simple: help you speak better.

The output gives direct coaching tied to your goals and adoption targets. It highlights strengths and clear gaps, with steps you can take to improve. It includes example responses, sample transcript snippets, and best practices. It also adds ideas for value‑based workshops and partner services that can help you run better customer conversations.
