**These prompts are designed to get thoughtful, constructive self‑feedback from the AI based on your real background and goals. You paste it as a single question, and it asks the AI to identify a small number of potential blind spots while keeping the tone supportive and practical. The instructions guide the AI to stay grounded in your experience, avoid fluff, use a consultant-style structure, and include actionable advice you can actually use. This works well when you want honest reflection that helps you improve professionally or sharpen your content, without turning into vague or overly soft feedback.**

## Prompt

Based on my background and everything you know about me, what are three traits that could hold me back professionally, in content creation, and collaboration? Keep it constructive. Use a consultant-style breakdown with categories, bullet points, and actionable advice. Match my tone: direct, helpful, and casual. Avoid fluff.
